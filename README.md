A decentralized casino and house liquidity pool.

Liquidity providers can add any token to the houses liquidity and are intitled to the houseâ€™s earnings in proportion to the size of their contribution.

Developers can use the houses liquidity to build their own games, if they have a funded Chainlink VRF v2 subscription, and the odds give the house an edge of at least 1%.

Players can play betting games with a very low house edge, and with any ERC20 standard token, if the token has sufficient liquidity in the house pool.
